# Initial prompt to Claude.ai

> Using all the information above, let's start again with the problem definition. I want a macOS Swift function that implements a command-line program that takes an SSID (string) and retrieves the password from the Keychain, then uses that password to connect to the named SSID. If everything works, stdout and stderr should be "", and the result should be noErr. If there is an error, (no password in the keychain for the SSID, or the keychain's password does not connect/work), return non-zero result, and stderr should have a relevant error message. Also check for other error cases, and produce a reasonable error.

## Claude.ai sez

Here's a clean implementation that meets your exact requirements:

## Key Features:

**Input:** Takes a single SSID string as command line argument

**Keychain Lookup:** Automatically retrieves the Wi-Fi password from the macOS keychain (stored under service "AirPort")

**Connection:** Uses CoreWLAN to connect to the specified network

**Output Behavior:**

- **Success**: No stdout output, returns 0
- **Error**: Error messages go to stderr, returns non-zero exit code

**Error Handling:**

- Exit code 0: Success
- Exit code 1: SSID not found in available networks  
- Exit code 2: Authentication failed (wrong password)
- Exit code 3: No password found in keychain
- Exit code 4: General error (scan failure, etc.)
- Exit code 5: Invalid arguments
- Exit code 6: Wi-Fi interface access error

**Special Features:**

- Retry logic for iPhone hotspots (scans multiple times)
- Verification that connection actually succeeded
- Proper error code mapping from CoreWLAN

## Build and Usage

```bash
# Compile
swiftc -framework CoreWLAN -framework Security -o wifi-connect wifi-connect.swift

# Use
./wifi-connect "MyNetwork"
echo $?  # Check exit code

# Or with sudo if needed for Wi-Fi interface access
sudo ./wifi-connect "MyNetwork"
echo $?
```

## Example Output

**Success case:**

```bash
./wifi-connect "MyNetwork"
# (no output)
echo $?
# 0
```

**Error cases:**

```bash
./wifi-connect "NonExistentNetwork"
# Error: No password found in keychain for SSID 'NonExistentNetwork'
echo $?
# 3
```

The implementation is focused and clean - it does exactly what you specified without extra features or verbose output.
